    <summary>Gradle is a modern open source polyglot build automation system. It can automate and integrate your devOps toolchain with a concise and expressive build programming language based upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven.</summary>
    <description>Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Apache Ant with the dependency management and conventions of Apache Maven into a more effective way to build. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through sensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and legacy automation challenges.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build automation across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, and Groovy, and is closely integrated with development tools and continuous integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Jenkins.

    <releaseNotes>The Gradle team has an important update to 3.4. This release fixes critical defects to the Java incremental compilation that may prevent recompilation.

It does not include any new features. We recommend anyone upgrading from an older version to upgrade straight to Gradle 3.4.1 instead of Gradle 3.4.
